## SURF'S UP

### OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS
The purpose of this analysis is to retrieve temperature trend information for June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. Our client, W. Avy, is considering opening an ice cream and surf shop and needs to determine if the business is sustainable year-round.
This analysis was done using Pandas and SQLAlchemy within Jupyter Notebook.

### RESULTS
* June Analysis — according to our research the average temperature in June is 75 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.25. Given that the purpose of the shop is to provide surfing equipment and ice cream, this presents an ideal weather for the shop. Although the minimum temperature recorded in June is 64 degrees the shop can still provide surfing equipment. In spite the fact that people might not be inclined to get ice cream, W. Avy can still provide surfing equipment. Because Hawaii si a hotspot for surfing, not only for vacationing and ice cream, the shop should not be heavily impacted by a lack of customers.

* December Analysis — according to our research the average temperature in December in Oahu is 71.04 with a standard deviation of 3.74. The minimum temperature recorded is 56 and the highest is 83. Although the highest temperature in december is close to the one in June (85 degrees) there is a clear difference between the minimum temperature in both months. Even if the minimum temperature is pretty low for people to want ice cream, it is important to keep in mind that this is the lowest point recorded and that the average is still fairly similar to the one in december.

* Comparing both analysis — both months present promising weather for the purpose of the surf shop. Although the temperature in June seems more stable than the one in December, they are still fairly similar. The only data point that could be worrisome is the minimum temperature of 64 recorded in december. It is important to consider that this analysis looked into various years, meaning that the 64 degrees recorded are an outlier.

### SUMMARY
Although only two months were compared it is safe to assume that the climate in Oahu Hawaii is fairly stable year-round. We can state this with confidence given that this analysis took into consideration the temperature recorded across many years. That being said, the original purpose of this analysis was to provide our client with information that will help him and his investors decide if opening an ice cream and surf shop is a lucrative/sustaniable business in Oahu Hawaii. The only information requested was  temperature readings. It would be helpful for our client to also consider precipitation for example. Given that Hawaii is known for its beaches, most locals and tourists might be swayed away from surfing if a particular month gets a considerable amount of rain. We could run the same queries we did for temperature but for precipitation to give our client a better understanding of the weather in Oahu. Another crucial query we could run is for wind speed. Even though the temperature analysis is a great general indicator of how the shop could perform with clients looking for surfing equipment and/or ice cream, a wind speed analysis would be beneficial for our client to understand how surfing could be impacted year-round.

Another point that comes to mind is that W. Avy wanted to open the shop in Oahu because of the personal connection he has with the island. There is a total of 137 islands in Hawaii with Oahu being one of the largest ones. That being said, there has been no examination of the weather fluctiations in the rest of the islands, tourist flow or prominence of surfing overall. By including the other big islands (Maui, Kauai, Niihau, Lanai, Molokai, Hawaii) W. Avy and his investors could get a bigger picture of their prospects. Although W. Avy's personal connection to Oahu is what set him and his investors in this path they could be missing out in setting a flag in a better location. By running the same queries done in this analysis and the ones proposed they could get a bigger picture of their opportunities. Even if they decided that they wanted to start in Oahu this could help them decide to which islands they could branch out in the future if the surf shop becomes the dream business they envisioned.
